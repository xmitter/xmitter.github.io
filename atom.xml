    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well it was pretty busy yesterday, so I didn&#x27;t get a chance to finish the bash script I started. It&#x27;s half functional right now, it just adds a new post and creates a really basic header for it. Next step is to have it add to the Makefile.</p>
<p>After that I&#x27;d like to automate the make process and git pushing and what not, to make things real easy. I&#x27;m sure I can do all that in bash, but maybe Python or Ruby would be good to try. I know I hated on Ruby a little but I do like the language. It&#x27;s when you&#x27;re managing like three different versions of Ruby and different sets of gems and other dependancies that things get really gnarly.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well it&#x27;s a new week. We&#x27;ll have to see whether I can remember how to work all these things I set up, or if I get frustrated and just throw it all in the trash. Eh, I&#x27;m pretty confident I can make this work.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday and today I&#x27;ve been working on a small bash script to automate adding new posts, it&#x27;s working pretty well so far I should be able to finish it off today. Just about 20ish lines of bash, nothing fancy.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s clunky and a little more DIY than what I&#x27;ve worked on lately, but I think that&#x27;s a good thing, as I&#x27;m learning a lot.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well I have things working pretty well here, I think I&#x27;ve figured out why my ssh key wasn&#x27;t working for git pushes, so this post should work with that. I need to write a small bash script to automate new post creation, as the process is completely manual right now. Just a small thing to create the text file for a post, give it a title and insert it into the Makefile would be great. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Testing! This is a new blog post. I decided, for whatever reason, that I wanted to play with some static site generators. I started with Jekyll and Octopress, but those were pretty rickety and fiddly and annoying.</p>
<p>So now I&#x27;ve switched over to the blogc utility, built in C and even more barebones. It was a lot simpler to get it up and running than the Ruby tools even though there were some odd Ruby requirements when compiling. I don&#x27;t know if this will be a regular thing, but it&#x27;s been interesting so far.</p>
