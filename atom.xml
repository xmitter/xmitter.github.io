    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday and today I&#x27;ve been working on a small bash scrip to automate adding new posts, it&#x27;s working pretty well so far I should be able to finish it off today. Just about 20ish lines of bash, nothing fancy.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s clunky and a little more DIY than what I&#x27;ve worked on lately, but I think that&#x27;s a good thing, as I&#x27;m learning a lot.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well I have things working pretty well here, I think I&#x27;ve figured out why my ssh key wasn&#x27;t working for git pushes, so Thi spost should work with that. I need to write a small bash script to automate new post creation, as the process is completely manual right now. Just a small thing to create the text file for a post, give it a totle ad insert it into the Makefile would be great. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Testing! This is a new blog post. I decided, for whatever reason, that I wanted to play with some static site generators. I started with Jekyll and Octopress, but those were pretty rickety and fiddly and annoying.</p>
<p>So now I&#x27;ve switched over to the blogc utility, built in C and even more barebones. It was a lot simpler to get it up and running than the Ruby tools even though there were some odd Ruby requirements when compiling. I don&#x27;t know if this will be a regular thing, but it&#x27;s been interesting so far.</p>
